        <p>
          Alignment is an important part of a clear, organized and readable
          document. In particular, it helps the reader to look at a page and
          immediately know its purpose. Alignment can be used to organize
          information horizontally (left or right) or vertically (top down or
          bottom up).

        </div>
        <p>
          The proximity principle is a common design technique that is used to
          create unity in visual designs. It's got two main characteristics:
          close proximity, as well as contrast or variation of elements within
          the composition. On this site, the related elements are organized into
          groups based on color.

        <h3>Momentum Energy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.momentumenergy.com.au/"
              >https://www.momentumenergy.com.au/</a
            >

        <div class="img">
          <img src="./images/repetition.jpeg" alt="" width="380" height="760" />
        </div>
        <p>
          I can clearly see the principle of repetition, as an element is being
          repeated several times, which creates a feeling of organized movement
          and consistency within a composition. In turn, it creates an intrusion
          to promote the effectiveness of the product, which I believe is in
          other words, a marketing strategy, which gives more prestige and
          recognition to the site.
